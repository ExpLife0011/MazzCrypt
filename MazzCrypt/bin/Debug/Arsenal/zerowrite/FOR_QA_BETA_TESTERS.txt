Thanks for being an assigned QA Tester for Zerowrite.

In your name-assigned .zip, you should have:

* 5 random .exe's
* settings.ini
* cleanEvidence.bat


Your duty before testing:
===========================================
1. Go on alt account
2. Launch CSGO
3. Launch any of the random .exe's
4. Go to Matchmaking. [[ DO NOT USE ESEA, CEVO, FaceIT or Popflash on these builds. They are NOT compatible and you WILL be banned!! ]]
5. Change/experiment with settings.ini to your liking (you can edit this while the cheat is running)
6. Play 2-3 games on Matchmaking
7. Report feedback/gitches or any bans that may occur to Zerowriter (Justin).
	* Say what is wrong
	* Explain PRECISELY what you are experiencing or steps to replicate what is happening.
============================================

 [[ NOTE: Keep in mind, if you get Overwatch banned, it is your own fault. This cheat only READS memory. It is impossible for it write memory as I didn't even MAKE a function to write memory ]]

Your duty after testing the cheat:
=======================================
* Press END on the cheat and wait until the cheat says "Threads ending", and the cheat closes itself.
* If you're on Windows 10:
	1.	Hold the Windows key and press X. A menu should popup
	2.	Click on "Command Prompt (Admin)". It needs to be the one with (Admin).
	3.	type 'cd '
	4.	Following that, in quotes put the directory of where you've extracted the contents of this .zip into. Press Enter.
	5.	If you're in the correct directory if you type 'clean' and press Tab, you should see it auto-complete cleanEvidence.bat
	5a.	If you don't see this, go back to step 3
	6.	Press Enter. This will run the .bat.
* If you're not on Windows 10:
	1. Right click cleanEvidence.bat and click Run as Administrator

* Steam, CSGO should close itself and your computer should restart.
